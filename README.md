Aeroponia- Aeroponic Farming in Space:

This project simulates and analyzes the conditions required for aeroponic farming in space. Aeroponics is a soil-free farming technique that uses a nutrient-rich mist to grow plants, making it ideal for environments like space where traditional farming is not feasible. The project focuses on monitoring and visualizing key environmental parameters—temperature, humidity, and pH—for three plants: Tomato, Potato, and Strawberry.

Objective:

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how aeroponic farming can be monitored and managed in space by simulating sensor data, detecting anomalies, and visualizing the results. This provides insights into maintaining optimal conditions for plant growth in extraterrestrial environments.

Features:

Simulates sensor data for plants under controlled aeroponic conditions.
Detects anomalies in environmental parameters based on predefined ideal ranges.
Visualizes individual plant data with anomalies highlighted.
